Heart Disease Analysis Project

Objective

The Heart Disease Analysis project aims to explore a dataset related to heart disease to identify key factors contributing to its occurrence. By employing data analytics techniques, the goal is to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant features. This analysis strives to offer insights that could aid in early diagnosis and prevention strategies.

Responsibilities
1.	Data Cleaning
	Addressed missing values, managed outliers, and resolved data inconsistencies to ensure the dataset's quality and readiness for analysis.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	Conducted EDA to examine data distributions and identify relationships between key variables.
3.	Data Visualization
	Created insightful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate findings clearly and effectively. These visualizations included scatter plots, box plots, and various charts to enhance understanding of the data.

Research Questions
1.	Heart Disease Prevalence
	How many people have heart disease versus those who do not?
2.	Gender and Heart Disease
	Which gender has a higher prevalence of heart disease?
3.	Chest Pain Types by Gender
	Which types of chest pain are most common among each gender?
4.	Chest Pain and Heart Disease Correlation
	Which chest pain type is most closely linked to heart disease?
5.	Resting Blood Pressure Variations
	How does resting blood pressure differ between patients with and without heart disease?
6.	Cholesterol and Heart Disease
	Is there a correlation between higher cholesterol levels and an increased likelihood of heart disease?
7.	Exercise-Induced Angina
	How does exercise-induced angina (exang) vary between those with and without heart disease?
